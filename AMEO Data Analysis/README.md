# Engineering Graduates Career Trajectory Optimization

## Introduction

The engineering industry is facing a challenge in optimizing the career trajectory of its graduates. Despite possessing diverse cognitive, technical, and personality skills, many engineering graduates struggle to secure favorable employment opportunities in a fiercely competitive job market. In response to this challenge, an extensive data exploration and analysis initiative is undertaken to unveil actionable insights that will transform the employment landscape for engineering graduates.

## Business Problem Statement

The engineering industry is currently confronted with the challenge of optimizing the career trajectory of its graduates. Despite possessing diverse cognitive, technical, and personality skills, many engineering graduates struggle in a fiercely competitive job market.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to explore relationships between independent variables and the target dependent variable, identify patterns and trends within the data, and address specific research questions to provide actionable insights for optimizing the career trajectory of engineering graduates.

## Research Questions

1. **Verification of Salary Claim**: Test the claim made in a Times of India article dated Jan 18, 2019, regarding the earning potential of fresh Computer Science Engineering graduates in various job roles.
2. **Gender-Specialization Relationship**: Investigate whether there is a relationship between gender and specialization among engineering graduates.

## Insights from Data Exploration

### Academic Performance Insights:

- Both 10th and 12th percentages exhibit a clustered distribution between 65% to 90%, with a significant portion of students scoring above 65%.
- College GPA distribution also shows a concentration between 65 to 85, with fewer students having exceptionally high GPAs above 95.

### CGPA as a Determinant:

- CGPA above 60% is associated with enhanced job prospects and salary negotiation power.
- A threshold effect suggests a minimum CGPA requirement for favorable employment opportunities.

### Gender Distribution Insights:

- Males constitute around 70% of the dataset, indicating a gender imbalance.
- Gender distribution is vital for ensuring inclusivity in hiring processes and workplace environments.

### Correlation Analysis:

- Significant positive correlations exist between 10th/12th percentages, college GPA, and salary.
- Candidates with higher academic performance tend to negotiate higher salaries.

### Job City and College State:

- Major job hubs include Bangalore, Noida, Pune, Gurgaon, and Mumbai, while top college states comprise Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra.
- These locations indicate strong employment and educational infrastructure, respectively.

### Employment Insights:

- High-paying roles like Data Scientist and Senior Developer command lucrative salaries within IT firms.
- Leadership positions such as Branch Manager also correlate with higher compensation.

### Key Employment Insights:

- Cities like Gurgaon, Bangalore, and Pune are prominent destinations for high-paying data analysis roles.
- Emerging markets such as Visakhapatnam and Coimbatore offer growing opportunities in the field.

## Conclusion

- The claim that fresh graduates can earn up to 2.5-3 lakhs is not supported by the data, based on statistical analysis of the variables.
- There is no significant association between gender and specialization among engineering graduates, as indicated by the p-value exceeding the significance level.

## Actionable Insights

- Emphasize the importance of academic performance, particularly maintaining a CGPA above 60%, for better job prospects.
- Encourage inclusivity in hiring processes and workplace environments to address gender imbalances within the engineering industry.
- Provide guidance to engineering graduates regarding job markets and key employment opportunities in various cities and sectors.

## Future Directions

- Further exploration of factors influencing salary negotiation power and career advancement opportunities for engineering graduates.
- Longitudinal studies to track the career trajectories of engineering graduates over time and assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at optimizing their career paths.
