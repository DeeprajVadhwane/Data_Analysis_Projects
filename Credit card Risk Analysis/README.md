# Credit Risk Analysis Insights

Welcome to the Credit Risk Analysis Insights project! This repository is dedicated to unraveling game-changing insights from a dataset associated with credit risk. Here's a glimpse into the transformative discoveries made in this project:
## Business/Domain Understanding

Financial markets are fundamental institutions in any developing economy. They play a crucial role in promoting economic growth by facilitating the channeling of
saving decisions into productive investment. A major concern for financial institutions is credit risk, because if not managed properly, it can lead to a banking collapse.
In our banking system, banks have many products to sell but the main source of income of any bank is on its credit line. Loan is the core business part of banks.
A bank's profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e. whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting.
Though a lot of people are applying for loans. However, they may have some difficulty in repaying the loan, due to their own capability to repay loan, their
personal monetary terms, etc.. It‚Äôs hard to select the genuine applicant, who will repay the loan. While doing the process manually, a lot of misconception may
happen to select the genuine applicant. The banks hold the risk of losing the amount loaned to the borrowers, which is basically regarded as "Credit risk".
Credit risk is the potential that a bank‚Äôs borrower or counterparty fails to meet its obligations in repaying the loan borrowed from the financial institutions ("banks").
By predicting the loan defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non-Performing Assets. This makes the study of this phenomenon very important.
Thus, the banks need to manage the credit risks in their portfolio both at the individual borrower and transactional level, as well as to consider the linkage
between credit risks and other types of risk. This is because these are criteria to assess the success/failure of any banking lending activities.
Many research confirmed that machine learning technology is highly efficient to predict this situation. This technique is applied through learning from previous data.

### What is Credit Risk?

Credit risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower will fail to meet their obligations
in repaying a debt. In other words, it's the risk that a borrower might default on a
loan or be unable to meet their contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss
for the lender.

Managing and assessing credit risk is a crucial aspect of financial management
for both lenders and borrowers. Lenders employ various tools and models, like
credit scoring systems, to evaluate and mitigate credit risk. Borrowers, on the
other hand, seek to maintain good creditworthiness to secure favorable lending
terms and opportunities.

# Task - Exploratory Data Analysis

Assume that you are working as a Data Scientist with one of the world's
leading financial institutions 
This is an open ended question. Kindly apply all your knowledge to perform an
exploratory data analysis on the given dataset.
#### It is known that the target variable is Loan Status.

However, you are mandatorily supposed to solve the below mentioned EDA Task
for your presentation:

1. Which variables are most significant with respect to the target variable?
2. Explore the data distribution of each column. Identify some important
patterns.
3. Insights and Recommendations.



## Key Insights:

üéØ **Age Insights:**
 - The dataset revealed a wide age range, from 20 to 144. However, an outlier at 144 was carefully addressed with median imputation.
 - Interestingly, I found that the probability of default payment is higher for individuals aged 20 to 28, gradually decreasing as age advances. This highlights the dynamic relationship between age and creditworthiness.

üí∞ **Loan Amount Implications:**
 - Loan amount proved to be a pivotal factor. Borrowers securing loans from financial institutions with higher amounts tend to have a higher default probability. Conversely, smaller loans had a less default effect found.
 - As loan amounts exceed a specific threshold, the probability of default decreases. This finding speaks to the importance of loan amount determinations.

üí∏ **Interest Rates and Borrower Behavior:**
 - A high interest rate correlates with a higher probability of borrowers defaulting. This underlines the need for a more comprehensive risk assessment associated with interest rates.
 - The density of loan defaulters is linked to higher interest rates as lenders respond to elevated risk.

üí° **Loan Intent Matters:**
 - Borrowers intending to use loans for Medical purposes exhibit high default rates. Many struggle to repay due to financial limitations.
 - Debt Consolidation loans, designed to alleviate debt burdens, also reflect a higher default rate, indicating that borrowers face challenges in managing their obligations.

üîç **Recommendations for Lenders:**
 - Lenders should evaluate creditworthiness holistically, considering factors like age, loan amount, and loan intent.
 - Tailoring loan terms, interest rates, and financial counseling for borrowers in need can significantly reduce default rates and foster financial well-being.
